This is a simple Mathematica script for plotting trees. To plot a tree of depth `d` with the root at `(x0, y0)`, call `draw[d, x0, y0]`.

You can more or less easily adjust the parameters than incluence the graph, e.g., 

- the angle between two consecutive edges,
- edge lengths and widths,
- vertex labels and sizes,
- ...
